# Project Docker Microcredential
micro-credential VIB/UGent - Reproducible data analysis

In this project, you will train and run a machine learning model using Docker. Furthermore, you will store the Docker image on your own account on Docker hub. Using this image, you will build an Apptainer image on the HPC of UGent.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Clone this repository to your personal github account
- [ ] Containerize training the machine learning model
- [ ] Train and run the machine learning model using Docker
- [ ] Store the image on your personal account on Docker Hub
- [ ] Build an Apptainer image on the HPC UGent
- [ ] Document the steps in a text document 

## Proposed steps - containerize and run training the machine learning model

Complete file named `Dockerfile.train`
Fill in the TODO sections.
- Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
- Copy train.py to the working directory
- Set the command to run train.py
- Run the training of the model on your computer
- Document the command as comment in the Dockerfile
- Store the created Dockerfile in your cloned github repository

## Proposed steps - store image on Dockerhub and build an Apptainer image on the HPC

- Create an account on Dockerhub
- Store the built image on your account
- Create a shell script on the HPC (Tier-2 cluster: donphan)
- Store the validated shell script in your cloned github repository
